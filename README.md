## ML for Fibromyalgia diagnostics
I have been living with this hard syndrome my entire life.
First, I had to diagnose myself by myself, then I had to figure out the treatment.
I share my experience here https://muscle-spasms.vercel.app

ML model to specify fibromyalgia cases in patients should be implemented in a diagnostic device. 
Pain level based on tissue temperature, tension, sensitivity.
